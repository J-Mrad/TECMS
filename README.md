# TECMS
The Eclipse Cinema Management System

TECMS was the first college project I worked on in mid 2017 over the course of a month. It is, as the name suggests, a quite basic cinema management GUI.

While some developers choose to hide their early work on a USB labeled "Project final done", I choose to share mine as it can be useful to both myself and others. 
For me it serves as a starting point for comparison. This was before I was introduced to the vast and ever changing world of libraries, frameworks, design patterns, and thorough documentation. These have become as embedded part of my routine be it finding new ways to implement them productively or just staying up to date on what the community is creating. One should always look back and where he was so he can see where he's heading. Over-used quotes aside, I really do enjoy looking back at past work sometimes and working on them again to bring them up  to my current level is always a fun challenge.. though I usually end up re-doing it from the ground up.
For other developers it can be, as it has been many times for me, a good coding playground to test out some new techniques. Simplicity in both code and design allows this project to be twisted and morphed while maintaining functionality all while having properly commented design to not get lost in a sea of code.
