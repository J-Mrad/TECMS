TECMS was the first college project I worked on in mid 2017 over the course of a month. It is, as the name suggests, a quite basic cinema management GUI.

Made in the context of a beginners java course so don't expect more than a default front-end and no design patterns. Useful to experiment with GUIs and basic transitions.
